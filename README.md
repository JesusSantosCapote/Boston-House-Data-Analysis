# Boston Housing Data Analysis

## Overview
As a Data Scientist at a housing agency in Boston, MA, I have been granted access to a dataset on housing prices from the U.S. Census Bureau. The goal is to present insights to the high management team to aid in informed decision-making. This project addresses several key questions regarding housing data.

## Key Questions
1. **Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River?**
2. **Is there any difference in the mean values of houses based on the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?**
3. **Can we conclude that there is no relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?**
4. **What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five employment centers in Boston on the mean value of owner-occupied homes?**

## Approach
Using appropriate statistical analyses and visualizations, this project aims to provide insights into the above questions. The following sections will detail the methodology and results.

## Methodology
1. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Conduct hypothesis tests to determine differences in median and mean values.
   - Perform correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.
   - Use regression analysis to assess the impact of distances on housing values.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Generate relevant plots and charts to illustrate findings.
   - Each visualization will include explanations to provide context and insights.

## Results and Insights
- The analysis results will be presented in this section, providing clear and actionable insights for the high management team.

## Project Structure
The project details are broken down into the following sections:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Steps taken to collect, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial analysis to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
3. **Statistical Tests**: Detailed description of the tests conducted and their results.
4. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and their implications for decision-making.
